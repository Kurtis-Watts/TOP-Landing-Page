This website is the second project within The Odin Project free learning series with the point of this project being to practise the core HTML skills learnt in the first part of the course. But to now start using the CSS skills learnt throughout the second major section of the course along in combination to build a functioning web page that looks good and complete.

A big part of this project will be using flex-box correctly to develop a well functioning arrangement.
